This is a game that combines elements of the Public Goods game and real-effort
transcription task into one. This game has 2 modes, one with transcription off and one 
with transcription on. In mode 1, where transcription mode is off, each player has a 
fixed income and must determine how much of his/her income to report. A tax of X% is
automatically collected from each player's reported income. The total tax collected is 
multiplied by a specified multiplier and then divided evenly among all players in the 
group. Each player's total money is the amount of income remaining after tax is deducted 
from their income plus his/her share of the total tax money.

In mode 2, Subjects are shown two images of incomprehensible text.
Subjects are required to transcribe (copy) the text into a text entry field.
The quality of a subject's transcription is measured by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>.
The accuracy of the players' transcription of the second image ultimately determines
each person's initial income. The remainder of mode 2 follows mode 1.
